# NAMD

NAMD is a widely used molecular dynamics application designed to simulate bio-molecular systems on a wide variety of compute platforms. The application can read a wide variety of different file formats, for example force fields, protein structure, which are commonly used in bio-molecular science. NAMD is written in C++ and parallelised using Charm++ parallel objects, which are implemented on top of MPI.
